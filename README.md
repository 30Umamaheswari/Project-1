**YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit**
**Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for harvesting, storing, and analyzing data from multiple YouTube channels. 
By utilizing Python scripting, Google API integration, MongoDB, and SQL databases, we have created a user-friendly Streamlit application that empowers users to gain insights from YouTube channel and video data.

**Skills Acquired**
Python Scripting: Extensive use of Python for data collection, manipulation, and integration with various APIs.
API Integration: Utilized the Google API client library to interact with the YouTube API for data retrieval.
Data Management: Employed MongoDB as a data lake to store unstructured and semi-structured data, while also leveraging SQL databases for structured data storage.
Streamlit: Developed a Streamlit app to provide an intuitive user interface for data input, analysis, and visualization.

**The primary objective was to create a Streamlight application with the following key features:**

Data Retrieval: Enable users to input a YouTube channel ID and retrieve essential data such as channel details, video statistics, likes, dislikes, and comments using the Google API.
Data Storage: Provide an option to store collected data in a MongoDB database, acting as a dynamic data lake.
Multiple Channel Data Collection: Facilitate data collection from up to 10 YouTube channels and store it in the MongoDB data lake.
SQL Database Migration: Allow users to select a channel for data migration from the data lake to a SQL database, structured in tables.
Data Retrieval from SQL: Provide multiple search options to retrieve and analyze data from the SQL database using SQL queries, including table joins.
